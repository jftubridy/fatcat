    <h1>Marvin is a big boy</h1>
    <h2>He used to be a huge cat</h2>
    <p>However we changed that by putting Otis' food bowl higher up so Marvin couldn't jump to it. Here are some things Marvin likes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sleeping </li>
      <li>Drooling</li>
      <li>Being a living space heater</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>One time he chewed on a power cord and shocked himself.</h3>
    <p>He is not the smartest cat, nor the most agile, but he is full of love.</p>
